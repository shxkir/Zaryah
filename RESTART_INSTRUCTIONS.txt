===============================================
    RESTART BACKEND & FLUTTER NOW
===============================================

Your backend is running with OLD code!
The errors you showed me prove this.

DO THIS NOW:

1. Backend Terminal:
   Press: Ctrl+C
   Type: node server.js
   Wait for: "🚀 Zaryah backend server running"

2. Flutter Terminal:
   Press: q
   Type: flutter run
   Wait 30 seconds for app to load

3. Test in app:
   - Map tab (will show users)
   - Profile picture upload (will work)
   - Finance tab (will show Apple, Microsoft, Google stocks)
   - Add friend (will work)

===============================================

Why US stocks instead of Indian stocks?

Your TwelveData API key is FREE TIER.
Free tier = US stocks only ✅
Paid tier = Indian stocks ($10+/month)

US stocks work great for testing!
(Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Tesla)

===============================================

If you want Indian stocks:
Upgrade at: https://twelvedata.com/pricing

For now, just restart and test with US stocks!
